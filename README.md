# ðŸ”¼ Batch project editor
 
Edits and commits changes to multiple projects automatically. It is designed for for [my @hejny`s](https://github.com/hejny?tab=repositories) projects management workflow. Feel free to fork and use it for yourself.

Inspired by older [batchgit-projects](https://github.com/hejny/batchgit-projects)
